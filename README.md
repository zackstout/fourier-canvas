Creating an animation of a crucial step in the Fourier transformation to deepen my mathematical understanding of it. Check out the live demo [here](https://zackstout.github.io/fourier-canvas/).

The main insight that drives the Fourier transformation is that any signal can be decomposed into a set of simple sinusoidal elements. In this animation, we're starting with the sinusoidal elements (depicted as a series of circular orbits) and then tracing out the signal that they generate.

## Animation:
The main idea is that the signal being charted on the lower canvas is composed out of the perfect sinusoidal signals represented by each spinning circle. The purpose of the Fourier transform is to decompose signals into their simple sinusoidal elements.

## Next Steps:
- [x] Want to make it rolling animation. (Watch until the graph hits the right side of the screen!)
