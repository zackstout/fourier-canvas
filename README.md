# Fourier Animation
Creating an animation of a crucial step in the Fourier transformation to deepen my mathematical understanding of it. Check out the live demo [here](https://zackstout.github.io/fourier-canvas/).

## Animation:
The main idea is that the signal being charted on the lower canvas is composed out of the perfect sinusoidal signals represented by each spinning circle. The purpose of the Fourier transform is to decompose signals into their simple sinusoidal elements.
